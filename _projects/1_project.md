Biodiversity monitoring is a foundational tool of the conservation world, providing data on where species are, how their populations are changing, and what the drivers of that change may be. Developing tools for optimal monitoring network design, implementing networks to meet policy objectives, and maximizing the usability of the produced data are main pillars of my work.

## Developing design and data processing infrastructure

Increasing recognition of the critical role monitoring plays in meeting conservation targets has led to a global push for more extensive, coordinated, monitoring efforts. However, accessibility of tools for designing new monitoring programs and processing the data lag far behind the demand for their use.

I am a contributing developer to the BON in a Box project, an initiative of <a href="https://geobon.org/">GEO BON</a>  (Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network) to develop a tool-sharing platform for monitoring network design, species distribution modelling, and calculation of Essential Biodiversity Variables {% cite griffith2024bon %}.

I am currently designing a range-wide acoustic monitoring program for the Mexican Spotted Owl in collaboration with US Fish and Wildlife, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and the US Forest Service. Passive accoustic monitoring is a powerful approach to sample the broad areas necessary for tracking populations of listed species.
